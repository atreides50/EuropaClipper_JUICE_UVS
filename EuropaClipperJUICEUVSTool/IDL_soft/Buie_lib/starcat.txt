  When promoting the normal ascii file (from refnet), promote to v1.0
     (no change to current operation)

  If file is a v1.0 file, do nothing

  If file is a v1.1, do nothing

rdstarc

  Add code to read v1.1 files, all information from this version is
    collected into an anonymous structure and returned.  Existing
    return values are populated but no new ones are added except for
    the structure.

  Add code to pack up all the v1.0 data into a structure.  Include the
    version in the structure.

  The v1.1 file must contain the equinox and epoch of the catalog data

  When reading, there is an optional epoch input keyword.  If the file
    is a v1.0 file the epoch input is ignored.  If the file is a v1.1
    then the return variables are corrected to that epoch.  The structure
    is not influenced by the epoch.

wrstarc

  structure input allowed instead of variables for v1.0, structure
    required for v1.1.

  when writing a file, there is an optional epoch input keyword.  If not
    provided the output will be a v1.1 file with full proper motion
    information saved in the file.  If it is provided, the positions are
    converted to that epoch and a v1.0 file is written.   This is ignored
    for v1.0 input through the arguments.
